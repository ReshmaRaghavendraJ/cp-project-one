<p>Centre for Youth (C4Y) is working as Monitoring Agency in association with the Ministry of Education, Government of India and the University Grant Commission (UGC), Government of India to support the National Ragging Prevention Programme in the country. C4Y monitors 24x7 anti-ragging helpline, compliances, technological support and creates awareness to demote ragging in universities, colleges across India.

Ragging has ruined countless innocent lives and careers.
In order to eradicate it, Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 887 of 2009, passed the judgement wherein guidelines were issued for setting up of a Central Crisis Hotline and Anti-Ragging database.
In accordance with the orders, UGC (University Grants Commission), Govt. of India has developed this web portal.
This portal will contain -
<ul>
  <li>Undertaking confirmed by each student and his/her parents or guardians, which will then be stored electronically and will contain the details of each student.</li>
  <li>Record of registered complaints received and the status of the action taken.</li></ul>
The aim of the portal is to eliminate ragging in all its forms from universities, deemed universities and other higher educational institutions in the country. This will be achieved by preventing its occurrence and punishing those who indulge in ragging, in accordance with the Supreme Court Regulations.
Kindly view Information Pack to know more details about ragging and its regulations.</p>
